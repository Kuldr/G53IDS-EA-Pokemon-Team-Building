Overview and recap of the project idea, including background and information on the topic.\\
Discussion of the upcoming deliverables and deadlines.\\
Agreed upon a deadline of the 11/10 for the project proposal and ethics form as well as the next meeting to discuss it on the 18/10.
\subparagraph{26th October}
Recap of the project proposal and confirmed it has been submitted.\\
Using python as the language to develop the project in
Overview of the next couple of weeks as per the work plan; revision/research of evolutionary algorithms and installing basic software.\\
Brief discussion on the possibility of writing up any research taking place, I will be looking into how to tie this into the interim report and bring up ideas at the next meeting.\\
Agreed to meet on 2/11 at 2pm.\\
\subparagraph{2nd November}
Spoke about the potential of drafting the interim report over the course of the project, agreed to do this continually through out and send the first iteration before the next meeting with sections and some bullet points.\\
Overview of the next stages in the plan.\\
Suggested having the basic GA outline to be running on a benchmark test to prove its working, this is to be shown at the next meeting.\\
Agreed to meet on 21/11 at 12 noon.\\
\subparagraph{21st November}
Reviewed the outline for the Interim Report, suggesting that its good but could potentially merge a few sections together.\\
Demonstrated the GA structure with on the sum of squares benchmark.\\
Discussed writing sections of the interim report now, particularly the related work section. This will be sent before the next meeting.\\
Agreed to meet on 24/11 at 1:30 to review the completed section of the interim report.\\
\subparagraph{28th November}
Reviewed the current draft of the related work section of the interim report, discussing how it can be improved.\\

\subparagraph{15th February}
Discussed the current progress, unable to show a demonstration of the running code due to a bug in the objective function evaluation.\\
Discussed the long running time of the code and how to overcome this for demonstration purposes, agreed that the demo day would work best as a more formal presentation containing the results and that output could be sent via email to show the project running.\\
Agreed to send the output of a working solution once the bug has been fixed, next meeting to be agreed once that has been completed.
\subparagraph{9th March}
