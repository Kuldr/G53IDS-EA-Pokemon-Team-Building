\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about aims and objectives
    \item Overall goal with the project
    \item Major steps to be taken
    \item Some of this can be adapted from the project proposal
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about other AI game playing and how they approach it
    \item Mention how these approaches assume things like pregame decisions
    \item Detail the problem
    \item Again some can be adapted from the project proposal
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss the Hearthstone deck building GA
    \item Investigate more works to talk about here (gaming and more general)
\end{itemize}
%Describe how many AI games are looking at playing
%However, previous works dealt with the AI aspects of the game in terms of automatic playing and behaviour design. Being the construction of the deck a very important part of this kind of games, where players may spend hundred of dollars in buying cards, it is quite surprising the lack of works in the literature proposing computational methods for automatic deck generation and analysis of their effectiveness. The only work related with this topic is [5], where the authors evolved decks of the game Dominion in order find methods to balance the game. However, they were limited to select 10 cards for each deck, extracted from a pool of 25, while in HearthStone, each deck requires 30 cards from a collection more than 600.
\par
Team building is a form of optimisation problem as you are trying to bring the optimal team to the match so you have the best chance of winning.
A variety of work has been conducted looking at optimisation via AI techniques, in particular I looked into techniques that tackled having a large, vast search space and where the correctness of a solution was hard to judge.
Both of these issues were things that I saw as issues that I would have to tackle to solve the team building problem.
\\ \par
Garc{\'\i}a-S{\'a}nchez et al.\ approached a very similar problem using a genetic algorithm, the problem in question was deck building\cite{hearthstoneAI}.
The example they used was a popular collectable card game, Hearthstone, and they tried to create a viable deck through the genetic algorithm.
This was of particular interest as several parts of their study directly relate to what I am trying to achieve, as well as several short comings that I would have to take into account.
\par
A evolutionary algorithm was used as `they commonly produce very effective combinations of elements', which a deck can be described as a combination of cards. This also allowed for competitive decks to be built from scratch with no expert knowledge.


\section{Description of the Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detail the output specifically
    \item Discuss building this solution from scratch (besides using relevant APIs outside of the main project), why this is beneficial
    \item Talk about both the EA and MA and how they will be linked
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Object Orientated Design and Python}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy adaptation
    \item Conversation from GA to MA
    \item Commonly used, lots of APIs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Evolutionary Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choice of GA and MA
    \item Why this over other AI techniques like ANN and Local Search
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Software Engineering Tools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Git
    \item Latex
    \item Atom
    \item Unit Tests
    \item How these tools work together and help with project management and speed up work
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Genetic Algorithm
    \item High level Representation Explanation
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Language and Platform choices
    \item Separation of settings
    \item Low level Representation Explanation
    \item Validation methods (if made by then)
    \item Use of the benchmark example
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
\subsection{Project Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss bringing Interim Report work forward
    \item Adding in of a benchmark function to test the GA Structure
    \item Review of individual tasks and how long they took
    \item Revised work plan, including changes to current progress and any prospective changes
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Contributions and Reflections}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Difficulties due to unpredicted work loads in other areas
    \item How moving forward aspects and adding additional tasks helped and hindered
    \item Current achievements in the project
    \item Personal Reflections
\end{itemize}
