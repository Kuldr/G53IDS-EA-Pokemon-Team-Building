\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about aims and objectives
    \item Overall goal with the project
    \item Major steps to be taken
    \item Some of this can be adapted from the project proposal
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about other AI game playing and how they approach it
    \item Mention how these approaches assume things like pregame decisions
    \item Detail the problem
    \item Again some can be adapted from the project proposal
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss the Hearthstone deck building GA
    \item Investigate more works to talk about here (gaming and more general)
\end{itemize}

\section{Description of the Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detail the output specifically
    \item Discuss building this solution from scratch (besides using relevant APIs outside of the main project), why this is beneficial
    \item Talk about both the EA and MA and how they will be linked
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Object Orientated Design and Python}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy adaptation
    \item Conversation from GA to MA
    \item Commonly used, lots of APIs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Evolutionary Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choice of GA and MA
    \item Why this over other AI techniques like ANN and Local Search
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Software Engineering Tools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Git
    \item Latex
    \item Atom
    \item Unit Tests
    \item How these tools work together and help with project management and speed up work
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Genetic Algorithm
    \item High level Representation Explanation
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Language and Platform choices
    \item Separation of settings
    \item Low level Representation Explanation
    \item Validation methods (if made by then)
    \item Use of the benchmark example
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
\subsection{Project Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss bringing Interim Report work forward
    \item Adding in of a benchmark function to test the GA Structure
    \item Review of individual tasks and how long they took
    \item Revised work plan, including changes to current progress and any prospective changes
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Contributions and Reflections}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Difficulties due to unpredicted work loads in other areas
    \item How moving forward aspects and adding additional tasks helped and hindered
    \item Current achievements in the project
    \item Personal Reflections
\end{itemize}
